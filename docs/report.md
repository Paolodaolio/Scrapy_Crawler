  The aim of this project is to infer social links between people based on their running records found on a community french website. The first part of this study was to collect the maximum amount of data from the website. The second part was to analyse this data using similarity metrics to find matching profiles. The produced tool is able to quantify the probability of two people knowing each other and for one person, reavealing all possible related people. The results of this study still have to be tested by contacting the recorded people and verifying the correctness of the infered social links.

# Data Analysis

All the collected data is processed to guess linked people in the set of collected runners. To do so, we need a function to quantify how probable is the fact that two people know each other based on their race records. This type of function is called similarity metrics. Metrics needs to be analysed to select the correct threshold and to compare how well they perform on this specific application. Finally, the refined metrics are used to build the Python application.

## Selected Similarity Metrics

The metrics chosen for this application are taken from the paper written by @cunche:hal-00747825.
To infer social link between runners, we need to see the races they have in common in their record and how likely they have been in contact in this race. To measure this second parameter, we use the number of participants in each common race. The less people there are in the race, the most probable it is that the two persons were in contact and may know each other. All the metrics are implemented in the file `analysis_module/metrics.py`

- *Jaccard index*: This metric focuses on the proportion of common races in the record. it is defined as $\text{J}(X,Y) = \frac{|X \cap Y|}{|X \cup Y|}$. It is implemented in the function `jaccard_index`.

- *IDF similarity*: This metric depends on a measure of the rarity of a race defined as $IDF_i = \log \frac{1}{f_i}$ with the frequency of the race $f_i$ the number of participants. Finally the metric is define as followed.
$$
\text{Cosine-IDF}(X,Y) = \frac{\sum_{x \in X \cap Y} IDF_x^2}{\sqrt{\sum_{x \in X} IDF_x^2} \sqrt{\sum_{y \in Y} IDF_y^2}}
$$
 It is implemented in the function `idf_similarity`.

- *Adamic similarity*: This metric also depends on the frequency $f_i$ defined as the number of participants in the race $i$. This metric is defined as $\text{Adamic}(X,Y) = \sum_{i \in X \cap Y} \frac{1}{\log f_i}$. It is implemented in the function `adamic_similarity`.

- *Modified Adamic similarity*: In order to put more weight on the rarity of the races, the Adamic similarity is changed to $\text{Psim-q}(X,Y) = \sum_{i \in X \cap Y} \frac{1}{f_i^q}$. It is implemented in the function `psim_q`.
