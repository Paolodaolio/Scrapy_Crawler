  The aim of this project is to infer social links between people based on their running records found on a community french website. The first part of this study was to collect the maximum amount of data from the website. The second part was to analyse this data using similarity metrics to find matching profiles. The produced tool is able to quantify the probability of two people knowing each other and for one person, reavealing all possible related people. The results of this study still have to be tested by contacting the recorded people and verifying the correctness of the infered social links.
